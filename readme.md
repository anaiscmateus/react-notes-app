- submit notes
- pin important notes
- test coverage for api endpoints and any react components for the front end
- utilize things covered in the readings (CRUD, with a React front end)
- Get as far and fast as you can, but emphasize the test coverage (use the tools that were covered in the reading)
- And have documentation around the testing so we can use it going forward (focus on reusability and clarity)
- $1k bounty for group that builds best docs about how to use the tests in the relation to the project
- 2hrs of class time to work on it now, and entire project is due next monday
- Use time right now to divvy up the tasks and figure out where and how people can contribute
- put on github ideally and docs should be a readme file
